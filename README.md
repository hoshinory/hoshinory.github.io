# Introduction
My girl friend told me it's difficult to admit we are ordinary.

I have never done something from the start to the end is past few years. 

We take some lessons such as Mathematics and Linear Algebert when we in college. \
Of course, I got a high score in most of test. It seems like that I have understood these knowledges. \
But I'm just put the numbers into formular that proved by others and calculate a answer? \
I don not think I have learned them. I don't known how the method and formular was supposed? for what problems? how to do that step by step? \
It botherd me for a long period.

I'm not very clever and even a little bit stupid. Maybe I can't consider all answers if my whole life, I'll keep thinking.
